#End of the Loop

Using forEach and map and filter from the Array
prototype. We can avoid loops.    

Why avoid loops you ask? Because, loops can only iterate   
over static or synchronous data, the data we work with    
today is mostly dynamic or asynchronous. With map and    
filter and forEach, we can build complex apps that can    
handle any kind of data, be it synchronous or asynchronous!
